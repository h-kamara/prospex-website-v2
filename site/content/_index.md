    Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options,
    but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or
    are being redeveloped. Many don’t feel safe travelling to the places which
    remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour.
    Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home.


    Our youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people, learn
    new skills, and enjoy themselves in an environment designed to promote
    positive wellbeing. We have a ‘Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds’ approach –
    stimulating both the physical body, and the mind. We run regular cooking,
    gardening, arts and crafts, team building, and personal development
    sessions, coupled with sports, physical activity and trips to the
    countryside.


    Whatever they feel like doing, whoever they are, and whoever they wish to
    be, we want every young person to find a home at Prospex.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone.

    Our team does more than just meet and engage with young people within the
    confines of the centre.


    We have been advocates for our children and teens with school, the police,
    and other authorities. We meet with parents and their peers to help mediate
    conflicts, and accompany them to meetings or important appointments to
    provide support. If we feel their voices are not being heard, we speak up,
    and encourage them to do the same. We listen when they need us to, and
    signpost them to other organisations where necessary.


    Our team and volunteers build lasting, meaningful relationships with the
    young people who come to us. We let them be themselves and engage in
    positive activities designed to promote and stimulate healthy bodies and
    healthy minds.
